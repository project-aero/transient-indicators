We find that a cost function that determines a Boltzmann-like stationary distribution can always be defined near it. Such a stationary distribution does not need to satisfy the usual detailed balance condition but might have instead a divergence-free probability current. In the linear case, the force can be split into two parts, one of which gives detailed balance with the diffusive motion, whereas the other induces cyclic motion on surfaces of constant cost function. By using the Jordan transformation for the force matrix, we find an explicit construction of the cost function. We discuss singularities of the transformation and their consequences for the stationary distribution. This Boltzmann-like distribution may be not unique, and nonlinear effects and boundary conditions may change the distribution and induce additional currents even in the neighborhood of a fixed point.},

	abstract = {The realization that complex systems such as ecological communities can collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing poses a serious challenge to our understanding and management of the natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that offers a way forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated that it is possible to define and detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain contexts. Here, we describe the pattern emerging as research continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid regime shifts, a pattern of “critical slowing down” that can be used to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down; (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when encountering a novel system, bearing in mind that a positive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others; and (c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning behaviors and noise.},

                  documenting progress in disease elimination are
                  important applications for the theory of critical
                  transitions. A key problem is the development of
                  theory relating the dynamical processes of
                  transmission to observable phenomena. In this paper,
                  we consider compartmental
                  susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) and
                  susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) models that
                  are slowly forced through a critical transition. We
                  derive expressions for the behavior of several
                  candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation
                  coefficient, variance, coefficient of variation, and
                  power spectra of SIS and SIR epidemics during the
                  approach to emergence or elimination. We validated
                  these expressions using individual-based
                  simulations. We further showed that moving-window
                  estimates of these quantities may be used for
                  anticipating critical transitions in infectious
                  disease systems. Although leading indicators of
                  elimination were highly predictive, we found the
                  approach to emergence to be much more difficult to
                  detect. It is hoped that these results, which show
                  the anticipation of critical transitions in
                  infectious disease systems to be theoretically
                  possible, may be used to guide the construction of

                  applications including mathematical biology, climate
                  change, human physiology and economics. Therefore it
                  is highly desirable to find early-warning signs. We
                  show that it is possible to classify critical
                  transitions by using bifurcation theory and normal
                  forms in the singular limit. Based on this
                  elementary classification, we analyze stochastic
                  fluctuations and calculate scaling laws of the
                  variance of stochastic sample paths near critical
                  transitions for fast-subsystem bifurcations up to
                  codimension two. The theory is applied to several
                  models: the Stommel–Cessi box model for the
                  thermohaline circulation from geoscience, an
                  epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive network, an
                  activator–inhibitor switch from systems biology, a
                  predator–prey system from ecology and to the Euler
                  buckling problem from classical mechanics. For the
                  Stommel–Cessi model we compare different detrending
                  techniques to calculate early-warning signs. In the
                  epidemics model we show that link densities could be
                  better variables for prediction than population
                  densities. The activator–inhibitor switch
                  demonstrates effects in three time-scale systems and
                  points out that excitable cells and molecular units
                  have information for subthreshold prediction. In the
                  predator–prey model explosive population growth near
                  a codimension-two bifurcation is investigated and we
                  show that early-warnings from normal forms can be
                  misleading in this context. In the biomechanical
                  model we demonstrate that early-warning signs for
                  buckling depend crucially on the control strategy
                  near the instability which illustrates the effect of
                  multiplicative noise.},

                  are sometimes preceded by early warning signals that
                  potentially could be used to predict and prevent a
                  forthcoming catastrophe. Universality of these early
                  warning signals has been proposed, but no formal
                  proof has been provided. Here, we show that in
                  relatively simple ecological models the most
                  commonly used early warning signals for a
                  catastrophic collapse can be silent. We underpin the
                  mathematical reason for this phenomenon, which
                  involves the direction of the eigenvectors of the
                  system. Our results demonstrate that claims on the
                  universality of early warning signals are not
                  correct, and that catastrophic collapses can occur
                  without prior warning. In order to correctly predict
                  a collapse and determine whether early warning
                  signals precede the collapse, detailed knowledge of
                  the mathematical structure of the approaching

The two classic “mean-field” epidemic models—either assuming density-dependent or frequency-dependent transmission—make predictions that are discordant with patterns seen in either within-population dynamics or across-population comparisons.  In this paper, we propose that the source of this inconsistency lies in the greatly simplifying “mean-field” assumption of transmission within a fully-mixed population.  Mixing in real populations is more accurately represented by a network of contacts, with interactions and infectious contacts confined to the local social neighborhood. We use network models to show that density-dependent transmission on heterogeneous networks often leads to apparent frequency dependency in the scaling of transmission across populations of different sizes. Network-methodology allows us to reconcile seemingly conflicting patterns of within- and across-population epidemiology.},
